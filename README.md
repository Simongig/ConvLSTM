# convLSTM for ML Course

## Preface

This repo was created in the Scope of the "Machine Learning" Course in the "Applied Computer Science" Masters Programm of HTW Berlin.
It aims to compare the classification qualities of a ConvLSTM and a regular LSTM on the task of detecting motor deficit of hospital patients in bed.
It uses joint coordinates generated by the MediaPipe Human-Pose-Estimation framwork by Google AI.
The project was done in the Computational Neurolgy working group at Charité. 
Data is not available for public for ethical and privacy reasons.

## Results

Results showed an AUC of 0.34 for the regular LSTM and 0.08 for the ConvLSTM.
Limited input data and high class imbalance and noise in landmark data were concluded as the main reasons for below chance classification results.

## Instructions

1. Create `data/` folder and unzip data from zip archive. Should look like this -> data/landmarks/...
2. Create `models/` folder
3. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
