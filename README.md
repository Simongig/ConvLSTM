# convLSTM for ML Course

## Preface

This repo was created in the Scope of the "Machine Learning" Course in the "Applied Computer Science" Masters Programm of HTW Berlin.
It aims to compare the classification qualities of a ConvLSTM and a regular LSTM on the task of detecting motor deficit of hospital patients in bed.
It uses joint coordinates generated by the MediaPipe Human-Pose-Estimation framwork by Google AI.
The project was done in the Computational Neurolgy working group at Charité.
